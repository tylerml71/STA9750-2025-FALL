#### **Hello, my name is Tyler Lara.** 
Born and raised in Queens, I have quite a few hobbies like photography, it really helps me get out and meet new people. 
 
I am a **Baruch Graduate Student**, with an expected graduation at **may of 2027**. I am currently looking to get employed in the data science field.

On this site, I have/will have multiple projects that represent my skill set for future employers.

```{r}
#| echo: false

if(!require("leaflet")){
    options(repos=c(CRAN="https://cloud.r-project.org"))
    install.packages("leaflet")
    stopifnot(require("leaflet"))
}

baruch_longitude <- -73.98333
baruch_latitude  <- +40.75028

leaflet() |>
  addTiles() |>
  setView(baruch_longitude, baruch_latitude, zoom=17) |>
  addPopups(baruch_longitude, baruch_latitude, 
            "I am a Master's student at <b>Baruch College</b>!")
