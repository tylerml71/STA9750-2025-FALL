title: "An example of the `contents` shortcode"
format: html

## Summary

My grandpa always said, {{< contents best_number >}}, but I also really like
{{< contents y_def >}} and I format it strangely because I am a scientist.

## I am using a Shortcode

`quarto` "shortcodes" can be used to do some magic when writing a document.
In this document we use the `contents` shortcode to move _output_ of code 
above the actual code. The [official docs](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/contents.html)
are not super clear, so hopefully this example helps. 

## Much later in the document

You can see how we find the best number using a very advanced algorithm: 

```{r}
#| results: hold

compute_best_number <- function(){
    return(3)
}

x <- compute_best_number()

y <- x + 3

x
cat("\n") #This should add spacing in between answers
y
```

We will define some 'snippets' here, but they do not get printed here because 
we instead move the output up earlier in the document. 

[The very best number is `{r} x`]{#best_number}

[`{r} formatC(y, format="e", digits=2)`]{#y_def}
